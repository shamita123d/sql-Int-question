# SQL INTERVIEW QUESTION

# 1 What is sql server?
SQL Server is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It is used to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. SQL Server uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with the database. It supports features like transactions, stored procedures, views, triggers, indexing, and security mechanisms. SQL Server is widely used for both small-scale and enterprise-level applications, providing high availability, backup, and data recovery solutions.
- It stores data in tables using rows and columns.
- It supports ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to maintain data integrity.
- You can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

# 2 What is Database?
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It stores information in a structured format using tables, and also includes schemas, queries, reports, views, and other objects to manage the data efficiently.

# 3 What is SQL?
Structured Query Language, also known as SQL, is a programming language designed for managing Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs). SQL is an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. In RDBMS all the data is stored in tables with each table consisting of rows and columns.

SQL is mainly used for:
- Creating and modifying database structures (DDL — Data Definition Language),
- Inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data (DML — Data Manipulation Language),
- Controlling access and permissions (DCL — Data Control Language).

 Syntax : 
CREATE DATABASE DatabaseName;

 USE DatabaseName;

Example:
CREATE DATABASE Student;

USE Student;

# 4 What is PL/SQL?
PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle’s extension to SQL that allows writing blocks of code containing SQL statements along with programming features like conditions, loops, and exception handling.It enables us to control the flow of execution using procedural logic inside the database itself.

PL/SQL Control Statements in Oracle

Control statements are very important in PL/SQL because they control the flow of the program.
- Control statements decide which part of the code will run, when, and how many times.
- Their syntax is easy to understand (similar to regular English).
- They help in decision making and repetitive operations.

Types of Control Statements (Branching and Looping)
- IF statement
- IF-THEN-ELSE statement
- Nested IF statements
- Branching with Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- WHILE loop
- FOR loop
